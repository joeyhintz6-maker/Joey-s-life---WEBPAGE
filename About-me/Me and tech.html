<h3>I love technology</h3>
<p>		One fact is that I realy love technology. But why? Here is why. It is becaus I thought they where cool when I was 5 years old and I thought they where cool. Because I have a vision impirmnt called Nystagmus. </p>

<h3>What is nystagmus?</h3>
<p> Nystagmus is a type of eye condition that makes my clear vision range shorter. Nystagmus also made it so my eyes don't get orders from the brain to look straight. So my eyes move around and I can never stop them, I've tried. </p>

<h3>How I got hooked on technology</h3>
<p> Anyways back to why I love technology. So since I couldn't see far technology like a iPhone or iPad was a gamechanger to my little 5 year old eyes. by using the built in Zoom app on IOS I was able to see way father then I've ever before. As I got older My vision got a little better and I didn't use technology as much as I did when I was 5. But when I was 5I was so fascinated that I got hooked on technology for good. Not 100% for seing but also I reserched more as I got older and started to like technology more </p>
<h3>All of my tech</h3>
<p>Now I have 6 or 7 computers. But how did I get all these computers? Well I'll tell you right..</p>
<p>Now! My first piece of technology was when I was 2. My mom and dad got me an iPad mini. Me and my brother had our own iPads and both iPads where the same model. Whe used them for about 2 years. But my iPads battery capacity go so decreased that it would only stay on for 4 - 5 mintues! And it was so long ago I can't remember what happened to my brothers My 2nd piece of tech i've ever got was a new iPad. It was an iPad 10th Gen. I think it had a 12in screen. I used this one for about 1 - 2 years and at the time my brother had a medel stand. The medel stand will be important for later. Anyway at the time and to this day. Our parents put our electronics in their room. When my dad was getting out of bed he grabbed my brothers little stand and he was getting my ipad off the flor and he dropped the medel stand onto my iPad. It shadered the screen and we had to buy a new one. At least it still turned on.</p>
<p> When I turned 6 for Christmas of 2023 our Mom and Dad got me and my brother nintendo switchs. Of course I lost the kickstand from my switch 2 mounths after I got it. So I took my brothers hehehe. For my 8th Birthday my Parents got me the biggest piece of tech yet. They gave me my dads friend iMac that Dads friend gave to my Dad. It was a iMac 2015 21in model. And then later in 2024 my grandma was getting a new iMac and I helped transfer her data to the new one I also helped here pick out the one she liked and I also helped her factory reset her old one. Then she gave it to me.
