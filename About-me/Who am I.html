<h1>Joey's personality</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Who do I act like?</h3>
<p>I have ADHD so somtimes when i'm board I pretend like my eyes the veiw of a camera and inside my brain I talk toy myself and act like I'm a YouTuber. Also in school I act like a nerd in my opinion because 1 I wear glasses and 2 I know almost every answer in math class.</p>

<h3>I mostly am...</h3>
<p>I think I'm a silly, goofy, and friendly kid. One fact about myself is that my ears are lisining 24\7. I kind of hear almost every single thing somone says. The way I tell if someone would be a good friend for me is if they laugh when I do somthing goofy.</p>
